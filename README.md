## Hi there 👋, I’m Saadman.

I recently graduated in Statistics & Finance and am building a project portfolio focused on data analytics, statistical modeling, and predictive insights.

I am currently developing a portfolio of real-world projects that will be uploaded progressively over the coming months. These will cover:

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Modeling  
- End-to-end data analytics workflows  
- Predictive modeling and statistical learning  
- Causal analysis and experimental design  
- Genetic algorithm optimization of neural networks for credit risk  

My goal is to showcase practical problem solving and data-driven decision making.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Time series analysis and forecasting  
- Multivariate statistical modeling  

If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out via email or phone. I’m always happy to discuss data, analytics, and new opportunities.
